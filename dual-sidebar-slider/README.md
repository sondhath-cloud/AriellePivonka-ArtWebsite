A Pen created on CodePen.

In this pen, Swiper JS is used for the responsive slider and you can navigate slides with the mousewheel. Each slide has an animated background and two different sidebars. Also, titles and boxes become visible with the fade-in animation. Finally, you can play or pause the audio whenever you want.

Note: Please, do not use it in profit-making platforms and projects without permission.
